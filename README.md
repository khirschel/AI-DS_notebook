# Reflection

README.md: Have a 2-paragraph section in here where you reflect on AI assistance with
this assignment
a. What concrete benefits did you see by utilizing AI to help you make the notebook? 
b. What dangers do you see for someone using AI to make this notebook without
learning data science properly? Give concrete examples.
c. Give examples where you needed to verify the AI output for correctness. How did
you know to verify those outputs?

## Response

One concrete benefit to having AI's make notebooks is structure. Sometimes when I create notebooks,I have trouble making my notebooks readable. 
Having an AI make my notebook can lead to nicely sectioned
python and markdown cells. This makes notebooks easier to read and leads to notebooks being more reproducable
and reliable. Using AI is also helpful for making graphs, instead of going to manuels to look up synax, I can ask AI and it can produce a specialized graph.A danger that can come with using AI and not understaniding data science is using AI to make decisions without having insight to the data. For example, a dataset can have 
historical data bias which can lead to data discrimination. Using an AI will make plots about the data and create algorithms for the data, but will not give you insight without
being propmted to do so. Anohter danger would be dependancy. Some institutions and companies do not want thier data being publicly seen and will require data analysis without use of 
outside tools. In this case, someone reliant on AI will not be able to do EDA.

One example that I needed to check the AI's output was making sure my dataset matched the AI's datset tha I had given it. It is possible to have AI generate and "fill in" datasets so it is 
crutial that we check that the datasets are the same. Another example of verifiing this outputs was by checking null values by myself to verify the AI is doing proper EDA. This can 
be done by having a small notebook to check simple procedures for correctness.
